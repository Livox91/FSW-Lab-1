    <p><b>Traffic Management System:</b> Used Different Data Structures for the implementation of traffic light system,
        routing
        paths,
        graphing maps and priority signals. Used QGIS (Geospatial Data Library) to import geographical data for dynamic
        maps.
        Used SFML to support User-friendly Inputs. <br>
        <b>Home IoT Simulation:</b> Simulated IoT devices in a LAN using Docker and macvlan Network on Linux. Developed
        a Web
        based
        Interface in Blazor Dotnet to control all devices. Stored Devices Statuses and Metadata in MongoDb. To Implement
        DHCP
        required for Simulation used Nmap for reconnaissance. <br>
        <b>Packet Sniffing Tool:</b> Used Passive reconnaissance to Capture Network Traffic via pyshark Captured and
        analyzed
        packet-level network. Stored Packet in (.pcap) for further analysis in Wireshark. Developed a web-based
